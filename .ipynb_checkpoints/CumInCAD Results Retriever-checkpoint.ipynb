This paper presents two successive algorithms for automatically segmenting building façades scanned by Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) into planar clusters and extracting their contours. Since majority of façade components are planes, the topic of automatic extraction of planar features has been studied. The RANSAC algorithm has been chosen among numerous methods. It is a robust estimator frequently used to compute model parameters from a dataset containing outliers, as it occurs in TLS data. Nevertheless, the RANSAC algorithm has been improved in order to extract the most significant planar clusters describing the main features composing the building façades. Subsequently, a second algorithm has been developed for extracting the contours of these features. The innovative idea presented in this paper is the efficient way to detect the points composing the contours. In order to evaluate the performances of both algorithms, they have successively been applied on samples with different characteristics, i.e. densities, types of façades and size of architectural details. Finally, a quality evaluation based on the comparison of planar clusters and contours obtained manually has been carried out. The results prove that the proposed algorithms deliver qualitative as well as quantitative satisfactory results and confirm that both algorithms are reliable for the forthcoming 3D modelling of building façades.\" \n",

In this paper, we attempt to develop a construction process which is suitable for all-terrain construction robot in the future. This construction process is inspired by beavers&#39; construction behavior in nature. Beavers select proper sticks to make the structure stable. We predict that particular properties of sticks contribute gravity-driven assembly of wood structure. Thus, we implement the system with machine learning to find proper properties of sticks to improve selection mechanism of construction process. During this construction process, 3D scanner on robotic arm scans and recognizes sticks on terrain, and then robot will select proper sticks and place them. After placement, the system will scan and record the results for learning mechanism.\" \n",

      "POINT:  name=\"eprints.abstract\" content=\"Beaver dams are formed by two main processes. One is that beavers select proper woods for constructing. The other one is that streams aggregate those woods to be assembled. Using this approach to construction structure is suitable for natural environment. In this paper, we attempt to develop a construction process which is suitable for all-terrain construction robot in the future. This construction process is inspired by beavers&#39; construction behavior in nature. Beavers select proper sticks to make the structure stable. We predict that particular properties of sticks contribute gravity-driven assembly of wood structure. Thus, we implement the system with machine learning to find proper properties of sticks to improve selection mechanism of construction process. During this construction process, 3D scanner on robotic arm scans and recognizes sticks on terrain, and then robot will select proper sticks and place them. After placement, the system will scan and record the results for learning mechanism.\" \n",
